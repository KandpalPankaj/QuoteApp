# üí¨ QuoteApp
> This is a very small project created with the purpose of learning the fundamentals of React.js starting from a simple [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üéØ About ##

I've started this project with the idea of reworking one of the ending projects of the Front End Libraries Certification (300 hours) of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).
I have structured the project with two small React components and I have styled it with the new TailwindCSS gradients.
One of the feature of this project is to share the current visible quote on Twitter via its icon.
